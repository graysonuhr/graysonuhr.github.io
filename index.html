			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p id="text">My name is Grayson Uhr, I am from Fort Worth, Texas. I have a twin sister, that goes to the University of South Carolina just like me. I was born in Baltimore Maryland and moved to Texas when I turned five. Growing up I had a dog named bullet, when bullet died I used one of my favorite things tattoos to commeorate him. Other than my tattoo for bullet I also have a shark and a manta ray tattoo.

					</p>
					<p class="hidden" id="one">One of my favorite thing to do is to scuba dive. This is where my love of marine life comes from. I have grown up scuba diving because my dad is a into scuba he led me to the thing I now love most. When I was deciding what to study in college, this love impacted my decison hevily. This lead me to the University of South Carolina to study Marine Science.</p>

			<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
				<p id="text">After I gradute I have one plan. I would like to finish my scuba diving classes, getting my resuce diver, dive master and instructor certifications. This is something I have alawys wanted to do but I wasnt sure if I wanted to use scuba for a Careeer. When I first got to college I wanted to do research and study sharks. I spent the summers between school working a program to get me to this point. But during this year I decided that I do not like doing reasearch and now do not want to go to grad school. 
					</p>
					<p class="hidden" id="two">After I made this decison that I was done with school I did not know what I was going to do for a career. I was pretty sure that I wanted to work as a scuba instrutor on an island but didnt know for sure. But during this winter break I went on a live abord dive trip and I fell in love. The second I got back from the trip I knew that that was exactly what I want to do as a career.</p>
